	First Glimpse
	\begin{itemize}
	\item
	\emph{Case 1}\\
	when $c=1$, the man who is wearing a hat looks around and see other guys don't get put on a hat. %
	The genie said that at least one guy is wearing a hat, and hence he could deduce the hat is on his head. %
	As a result, one night is needed for that person to dunk himself in the water.
	\item
	\emph{Case 2}\\
	happends when two men are wearing hats. They look around and see barely one hat but they are not sure %
	whether there is one hat or two. So these two guys wait until DAY $\#2$ and from their perspective, if the hat seen yesterday %
	still kept they can deduce $c=2$. Both of them would remove the hats on NIGHT $\#2$.
	\item
	\emph{Case General}\\
	if $c=n$ then the hats would be removed at NIGHT %\#n$.
	\end{itemize}
\item
	Proof by Induction
	\begin{itemize}
	\item
	\emph{Base case}\\
	$c=1$ if there is only one hat and that guy would dunk himself into the water consciously at the following night.
	\item
	\emph{Induction}\\
	assume true for $c=n$ that hats would be removed on NIGHT $\#n$. Let's prove that it's also true for $c=n+1$. %
	Each man with a hat sees $n$ hats and is unsure whether he has a hat or not (in another word, he is unsure $c=n$ %
	or $c=n+1$). And he knows that if there were $n$ hats then those hats would be removed on NIGHT $\#n$. If not, guys who %
	is wearing a hat could intelligently conclude that the ``last'' hat would be on his own head. So hats would be removed %
	at the same night (NIGHT $\#n+1$).
